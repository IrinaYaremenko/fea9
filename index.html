				<h2>ARC THE. HOTEL - Born of history, built around you.</h2>
				<p class="history">Historically owned by the iconic George Washington University and a pillar of the community, the
				transformation of the beloved GW University Inn to ARC
				THE.HOTEL, Washington, D.C. was thoughtfully crafted
				in tradition, with a lean toward the latest technology and
				purposeful service.</p>
				<p>Opening in Spring 2018, ARC THE.HOTEL, Washington, D.C. embarks on introducing the newest, and perhaps most appealing, four-star boutique in Washington DC. Situated within walking distance to the
				Kennedy Center of Performing Arts, George Washington
				University & Hospital, The National Academy of Science,
				The National Mall, DC Metro, and the trendy shopping,
				dining, & nightlife of <a href="#">Foggy Bottom</a> & Georgetown.</p>
				<p>In a world of shrinking space, our hotel
				continues to proudly offer rooms in excess of 300
				sq. ft.; giving you room to spread out and settle in.
				While enjoying the views of the historic Foggy
				Bottom neighborhood and the Potomac River, each
				guest will enjoy the comfort and convenience at
				their fingertips. Be it streaming your favorite
				entertainment application directly to your guest
				room HD television, ordering additional amenities
				with a touch of a button, perfecting your night’s
				sleep with our customizable pillow menu via mobile
				concierge, or coming and going with your mobile
				device as your key - you are sure to be delighted.</p>
				<p>Allow ARC THE.HOTEL, Washington, D.C. to
				seamlessly bridge timeless tradition with
				thoughtfully appointed technology and service.</p>
